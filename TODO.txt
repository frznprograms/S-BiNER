Dataset Preparation
- AlignmentDataset prepare dataset function
- __getitem__
- __len__

BinaryAlignment
- XLM-R integration

NER Annotation Projection
- use alignments to project labels onto new dataset
    - span-level alignment -> how will this be done for erroneous labels? Is there a way the algorithm can account for such cases?

Evaluation
- use the parallel corpora for csit to evaluate ner scores
- f1 score? 
- AER?

Documentation
- Organise better
    - main folder readme to just contain title, description, author, citations
    - inner folder readme to contain more explanations on how the code works
