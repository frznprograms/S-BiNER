Hi there, welcome to the 
## ùîÉetaùñÜlign
reposiotory.

### Description
This repository was designed to implement the BinaryAlign methodology as proposed in the paper (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12881), with customizations added for improved readability, and fine-tuning to improve model performance on Chinese word alignment (WA) tasks.

This methodology comes with the added twist of simple annotation projection for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.

### Instructions for usage
First, install the `uv` package management software for Python: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/.

Once installed, run the terminal command
```
uv init
```
and then 
```
uv sync
``` 
This will intialise a `.venv` folder and install the required dependencies for this project.

If you do not wish to use the `uv` package (though I would highly recommend it as it's really easy to use and wicked fast), you may also simply run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run inference using **ZetaAlign**, run the following terminal command: 
```

```
